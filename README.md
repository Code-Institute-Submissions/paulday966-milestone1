# Cafe Locator

The idea for this project came to me when I wanted to see a list of coffee shops in one place, but it wasn't available. On my weekend bike rides I have discovered a lot of coffee shops, and some of them have a theme. To start with I decided to select three counties close to home and three coffee shops for each one.
