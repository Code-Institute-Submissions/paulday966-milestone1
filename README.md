# Cafe Locator

The idea for this project came to me when I wanted to see a list of coffee shops in one place, but it wasn't easy to search for cafes in different counties in one place. I had to do multiple searches to find what I wanted. On my weekend bike rides I have discovered a lot of coffee shops, and some of them have a theme. To start with I decided to select three counties close to home and three coffee shops for each one, some with a theme and some without, but all of them welcoming. 

### UX

I wanted the older generations to have access to a list of coffee shops in different counties in one place so they can browse through them. It would be easy for them to see the key information then be able to go to their website for further information.

And the younger people that have smartphones, they would be able to access the site, see the key information and use Google Maps to guide them to the cafe.

### Features


### Existing features


### Features left to implement

A future update would be to add a photo gallery for each cafe, which displays their cakes and inside and or outside of the cafe. The user would be able to click on each image to expand it and easily close it.

Another feature is a section with links, descriptions and images for walks and places to visit in the nearby area. This could take the form of a database, or addtional pages with all of the information on them. The user will be able to print off the simple to follow walk descriptions. The walks would end at or near the cafe so the person could then visit the cafe. After the end of the visit to a nearby tourist attraction their will be directions to the cafe.

### Technologies used

#### HTML5

HTML5 was used to build the pages and display the text and images on the screen.

#### CSS3

CSS3 was used to style the cafe images and descriptions on each of the pages. This is to allow the users to view the images and text properly and clearly on large, medium and small screens.

#### Bootstrap

https://getbootstrap.com/

Bootstrap was used to create the two sections of the contact us page by clicking on the copy html link and pasting them on to the page. Booststrap was also used to add the column classes to the divs within rows, so the content would change responsivley on large, medium and small screen sizes.

#### Font Awesome

https://fontawesome.com/

Font Awesome was used to add icons at the beginning of the following paragraph's in the cafe's contact details:

* Address
* Phone
* Email
* Website

It was also used for the following items in the At a glance for each cafe:

* Food
* Outside seating
* Dogs allowed
* Public transport
* Parking

#### Google Fonts

https://fonts.google.com/

I have used Google Fonts to style the font font used on all pages.

### Testing


### Deployment


### Credits

#### Content

The navigation menu for each page was copied from the mobile first Whiskey Drop mini project I created during the previous module. CHECK THIS. This menu was exactly what I needed, so I changed all of the links and names of the links to the pages in my project and added in the contact page. I deleted the sign up section.

I copied the footer from the resume project, then deleted the links to LinkedIn, Pinterest and YouTube. I changed the name from Social to Social Media and removed the uppercase and general-sub classes. I added my own class to the social media title of footer-heading and changed the social-links class to social-media-links. I deleted the download CV link as it wasn't needed and removed the wording for the about section and added my own wording. I removed the uppercase and general-sub classes and added the footer-heading class and changed the title from About to About Us.

#### Acknowledgments

I got the inspiration for this project from cycling with the Cheam and Morden CTC group https://cheamandmorden.blogspot.com/ over many years. I found very few websites that had inforamtion about cafes in one place, and had to remember the cafe and website so I could look it up. 

Sent the following email to the following cafes asking permission to use their text and images.

Hi,

I'm currently studying an online full stack developer course with Code Institute and Learning People. This course teaches me how to build websites and how to write programs. For my first project  I'm building a website with links and information about coffee shops.

With your permission I would like to use the text and images from your website, so I can have a description of the place, what your offer, such as hot and cold food and an image to show what the place looks like.

Thank you

Paul Day
