# Cafe Locator

The idea for this project came to me when I wanted to see a list of coffee shops in one place, but it wasn't available. On my weekend bike rides I have discovered a lot of coffee shops, and some of them have a theme. To start with I decided to select three counties close to home and three coffee shops for each one.

### UX

Add user stories

Add links to the wireframes

### Features


### Existing features


### Features left to implement

A future update would be to add a photo gallery for each cafe, which displays their cakes and inside and or outside of the cafe. The user would be able to click on each image to expand it and easily close it.

Another feature is a section with links, descriptions and images for walks and places to visit in the nearby area. This could take the form of a database, or addtional pages with all of the information on them. The user will be able to print off the simple to follow walk descriptions. The walks would end at or near the cafe so the person could then visit the cafe. After the end of the visit to a nearby tourist attraction their will be directions to the cafe.

### Technologies used

#### HTML5

HTML5 was used to build the pages and display the text and images on the screen.

#### CSS3

CSS3 was used to style the cafe images and descriptions on each of the pages. This is to allow the users to view the images and text properly and clearly on large, medium and small screens.

#### Bootstrap

https://getbootstrap.com/

Bootstrap was used to create the two sections of the contact us page by clicking on the copy html link and pasting them on to the page. Booststrap was also used to add the column classes to the divs within rows, so the content would change responsivley on large, medium and small screen sizes.

#### Font Awesome

Font Awesome was used to add icons to the following list items

Contact details

#### Google Fonts

I have used Google Fonts to style the font font used on all pages.

Hi,

I'm currently studying an online full stack developer course with Code Institute and Learning People. This course teaches me how to build websites and how to write programs. For my first project  I'm building a website with links and information about coffee shops.

With your permission I would like to use the text and images from your website, so I can have a description of the place, what your offer, such as hot and cold food and an image to show what the place looks like.

Thank you

Paul Day
