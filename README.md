The idea for this project came to me when I wanted to see a list of coffee shops in different towns and counties on one website. Unfortunately I found this difficult, as I had to do multiple searches to find what I wanted. On my weekend bike rides I have discovered lots of coffee shops, and some of them have a theme, which I have inscluded in this website.

I wanted to change that by creating a website that is easy to use and has information and links to cafes in different towns and counties.

### UX

This website is for both the young and old who want to find out information about cafes quickly and easily. When they come to the website they can choose between three counties. After clicking on one of the options they will see the cafes for that county with an image of the cafe, a description and information about the place split up into four sections. Each section provides easy to see and read infomation to help the user select a cafe. The information provides basic at a glance information, such as outdoor seating, public transport links and snacks or cakes. The how to find us section has the cafe pinned on a Google Maps location card which can be expanded to fill an entire tab or Google Maps app. Then there is the opening hours section and the contact us section, with address, phone number, email address and website link.

* As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal

The first user type would be the older generations, who might not have access to smart phones. I want the user to be able to quickly access the list of cafes, with clear and easy to read information. This information can be printed off or written down so they can view it later when they need it.

The second user type would be the younger generation that have smartphones. They would be able to access the site on their smartphone or tablet see the key information such as address and use Google Maps to guide them to the cafe.

### Features

#### Existing features

* Feature 1 - Location of cafe using an embeded Google Maps. The user can see at a glance where the cafe is and if they click on it Google Maps will open up in a new tab and give users the full Google Maps experience

* Feature 2 - Newsletter sign up. When the user clicks on the link for the contact Us page the user has the option to sign up to the monthly newsletter

* Feature 3 - Link to cafe website. The user can click on the link to open the website in a new tab and find out more details about the place

* Feature 4 - Send cafe details. When the user clicks on the link for the contact Us page the user has the option to fill in details about a cafe they have found. The minimum details required are the cafe name and city, and a message pops up to remind them to fill these in if they haven't done so

#### Features left to implement

My first feature would be to add a photo gallery for each cafe, which displays images in a scrolling carousel of their cakes and inside and or outside of the cafe. The user would be able to click on each image to expand it, scroll through as many of the photos as the wish and easily close it when they have finished.

Another feature would be a page split up into three sections with one for each county. Each section would have descriptions, links and images for walks and places to visit near each cafe. The links for places to visit would take the user to the website for that place. The links for walks would take the user to different webites with walk ideas.

I would have a page with a Google Map on it to show where all of the cafes are, as another way to search.

My final update would be to connect this website to a database and have the infomation stored in that along with lots more cafes. The user would be able to search for a cafe based on search filters.

### Technologies used

#### HTML5

HTML5 was used to build the pages and display the text and images on the screen.

#### CSS3

CSS3 was used to style the cafe images, descriptions, titles and lists on each page. This is to allow the users to view the images and text properly and clearly on large, medium and small screens.

#### Bootstrap

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap was used to create and format the following:

* The two sections of the contact us page by clicking on the copy html link and pasting the html on to the contact us page
* It was used to add the column classes to the divs within rows so the content would change responsivley on large, medium and small screen sizes and be clear and   easy to read
* To create the information cards that display the information about each cafe
* To create the navigation menu at the top of the screen including the dropdown menu

#### Font Awesome

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

Font Awesome was used to add icons at the beginning of the following paragraph's in the cafe's contact us details:

* Address
* Phone number
* Email address
* Website

It was also used for the following items in the At a glance for each cafe:

* Food
* Outside seating
* Dogs allowed
* Public transport
* Parking

#### Google Fonts

I have used Google Fonts to style the font used on all pages.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

#### Github

I have used a Github repository to store all of the html and css files, the images used, wireframe pdf files and the Readme.md file.

* [Github](https://github.com/)

#### Gitpod

I used Gitpod to write and save the html files and CSS and store the CSS in a folder. It was also used to upload the images and wireframes into seperate folders. All of the work was saved to the repository for this project bit by bit by using git commands.

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

#### Embed Google Maps

I used this website to input the cafe's location, so that the location comes up on the on screen Google Map. Before generating the code I needed I was able to adjust the size of the map to my requirements. Once the code was generated I pasted it into the info card and deleted the parts I didn't need.

#### W3 Schools

I used this website to check on what I would need to do to build some of my ideas and also to make sure some of my code was correct. 

[w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)

#### Stackoverflow

I used this website to help explain the z-index for keeping the nav menu at the top of the screen when scolling

#### Freefavicon

I used this website to find a suitable fav icon.

[Free favicon](https://www.freefavicon.com/)

#### W3C Markup Validation Service

I used this website to make sure each page of html was correct, and then I was able to correct the mistakes.

[Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

#### W3C CSS Validation Service

I used this website to make sure the style.css page was correct, and then I was able to correct the mistakes.

### Testing

I have not automated my testing, so below are the steps to achieve the following

1. Go to one of the counties
* i Click on the Counties link in the navigation menu
* ii Click on one of the three options in the list. The options are: East Sussex, Kent and Surrey
* iii The selected page will open and you can browse the list and read about the cafes

2. How to find Us using Google Maps
* i Follow the steps in step 1. Go to one of the counties
* ii Find the cafe you want and you will see the Google Map
* iii The user can click on the plus or minus signs in the bottom right hand corner of the How to find us card to zoom in or out. This will help them see more or less of the area
* iv The user can also click on the View larger map link near the top left hand corner and the map will open up in Google Maps if it's installed, or into the default browser

3a. Contact Us. This page has two parts. The first part is Newsletter signup at the top of the page. I have added placeholder text to show the user how the email address should look when it's typed in
* i Click on the Contact Us link on the navigation menu
* ii If I click on the Submit button without entering my name or email address a message pops up underneath the Name field and says the following. Please fill in this field and nothing will be sumbitted
* iii For this part of the test I used the email address test@example.co.uk. If I type my name in, but leave the email address field blank and click on Submit a message pops up underneath the email address field saying Please fill in this field
* iv If the name has been added to the name field, but only the first part of the email address has been added and the user clicks on Submit a message pops up underneath the email address field. It says Please include an '@' in the email address. 'test' is missing an '@'
* v If the name has been added to the name field, but only the first part and the @ symbol have been entered a message pops up underneath the email address field and says. Please enter a part following '@'. 'test@' is incomplete
* vi If the name has been added to the name field and the email address is missing the last part so it looks like test@example a message pops up underneath the email address field and says. Please match the format requested
* vii The same message, Please match the format requested pops up if the email address looks like this. test@example.co
* viii If I type the same as the previous step but a dot after the co the message pops up and says. '.' is used at the wrong position in 'example.co.'.
* ix If I type in my name and the email address in the correct format, test@example.co.uk and click on Submit it is successful. A box pops up with the message Thanks for subscribing to our newsletter. If I click on the OK button in the pop up message it dissappears and the text in both fields is removed

3b. Contact Us. The second part of the Contact Us form is the cafe request form. I have added placeholder text in the cafe website address field to show how it should look
* i Click on the Contact Us link in the navigation menu
* ii If I click on the Submit button without typing text into any of the fields a message pops up underneath the Cafe Name field which says Please fill in this field
* iii If I type in a cafe name and nothing else the form won't be submitted because a message pops up underneath the Cafe website address field and says Please fill in this field
* iv For this part of the test I used the website address https://cafetest.com. If I type in the cafe name and the first part of the website address, http:// or https://, or any part of this a message pops up saying Please enter a URL
* v If I type in the cafe name and the first part of the website address, http:// or https:// and cafetest, then click on Submit the cursor moves to City and a message pops up saying Please fill in this field. Nothing is submitted. The cafe website address field accepts http://cafetest or https://cafetest and doesn't ask for .com or dot something else. I have added the following text underneath the cafe website address which says the following. You can copy the website address of the cafe into this box
* vi If I type in the cafe name, the website address and the city then click on submit a dialog box pops. The message says Thank you for sending us details of the cafe and there is an OK button. If I click on OK the box disappears and the boxes that have been filled in are now empty
* vii The cafe name, website address and city are required fields, as I thought that would be the minimum required to find more about the cafe
* viii The remaining fields are address, postcode and Do you have any additonal information that would be useful? are optional.
* ix If I type text in any of the fields I can cancel this request and clear the fields by clicking on the Cancel button

To help me make sure my website is responsive with different screen sizes, I tested it with Google Chrome's developer tools and changed the responsive screen size. I regularly checked this using the iPad, iPad Pro and various smartphone screen sizes and made changes to the Bootstrap col sizes for medium and large screen sizes. I tried to make the columns the same width to make it look better.

When I had built enough of the website I started to use the Github Pages link and tested the website with Chrome, Sarafi and Opera on my Mac, and Chrome, Edge and Opera on Windows. All of the browsers on Mac OS and Windows responded correctly, with the menu changing to the mobile view correctly for small screens. The text, images and info cards all moved correctly when the screen size was reduced to replicate the drop in screen size. The footer text and social media links moved positions correctly when the screen size was reduced.

When I tested the website on my iPhone and iPad it looked as expected, repsonded worked correctly and the mobile menu and all of the links worked correctly. The validation on the contact Us form worked correctly. When the correct text was typed in, the required boxes were filled in and the Submit button was pressed the dialog box poped up with the thank you message and the OK button. When I pressed OK the text in the fields was removed and it was ready for more text to be entered.

While I have been building this website I found lots of bugs and errors which I was able to fix and recheck to make sure the errors didn't happen again. Now that the website is finished I haven't found any bugs and my friends that have tested it haven't found any errors since I finished building it.

### Deployment

To make it easier for me to test my website in different browers and different devices I deployed my website to Github Pages. This allowed me to test the website on smartphones, tablets, Windows laptops and desktops, in Parallels desktop and my Mac mini.

To deploy the website I followed these steps

1. Logged into my GitHub account
2. Clicked on the link for my milestone1 project
3. On the row of icons near the top of the screen underneath the repository name I clicked on the Settings option (the last option)
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5. At the top of the GitHub Pages section there is a section called Source
6. In this section I clicked on the dropdown menu called Branch and selected master
7. Then I clicked on Save
8. Once I had done that the published link appeared just above the source section, which is https://paulday966.github.io/milestone1/

If I wanted to download my code so I could run it locally I would follow these steps

1. Log into my GitHub account
2. Click on the link for my milestone1 project
3. On the row of icons near the top of the screen underneath the repository name click on the <> Code option (the first option)
4. Just underneath this row of options, click on the green button labbelled Code with two downward facing arrows
5. Three options will appear in the dropdown.

#### Option 1 Clone with HTTPS

The first one will allow you to Clone with HTTPS

#### Option 2 Open with GitHub Desktop

Clicking on the second one will allow you to Open with GitHub Desktop. If you don't have the program installed it will take you to a webpage where you will be given the option to download the program for your operating system.

#### Option 3 Download ZIP

The third option will allow you to download a zip file with all of the files in it to your computer.

There is no need to use external hosting for this project as GitHub Pages can generate a link that allows me to access the website on mobile devices and desktops anywhere I want. This is becuase this project doesn't have a back end to it such as a database. It only has static pages. This will also save a lot of time as I don't have to go through the process of setting up an account with an external hosting company and making sure the site gets transfered accross properly and GitHub is free to use.

### Credits

#### Content

The navigation menu for each page was copied from the mobile first Whiskey Drop mini project I created during the previous module. CHECK THIS. This menu was exactly what I needed, so I changed all of the links and names of the links to the pages in my project and added in the contact page. I deleted the sign up section.

I copied the footer from the resume project, then deleted the links to LinkedIn, Pinterest and YouTube. I changed the name from Social to Social Media and removed the uppercase and general-sub classes. I added my own class to the social media title of footer-heading and changed the social-links class to social-media-links. I deleted the download CV link as it wasn't needed and removed the wording for the about section and added my own wording. I removed the uppercase and general-sub classes and added the footer-heading class and changed the title from About to About Us.

#### Acknowledgments

I got the inspiration for this project from cycling with the [Cheam and Morden CTC group](https://cheamandmorden.blogspot.com/) over many years. I found very few websites that had inforamtion about lots of different cafes in one place, and had to remember the cafe and website so I could look it up and get the details I needed.

I would like to thank my tutor Aaron Sinnott for helping me with this project, answering my questions and giving me advice and suggestions. It has been really useful and has helped me to think about each part and how I can improve it.

I would like to thank my friend Anja in the walking group I'm a member of for suggesting the title Quirky Cafes. This is much better than Cafe Locator, the title I was originally using.

I would also like to thank two other friends in the walking group Andrew Dodd and Helen Sheen for reviewing my site on Windows, Mac and smartphone. They pointed out errors, which I was able to fix.

Sent the following email to the nine cafes used in this website asking for their permission to use their text and images.

Hi,

I'm currently studying an online full stack developer course with Code Institute and Learning People. This course teaches me how to build websites and how to write programs. For my first project  I'm building a website with links and information about coffee shops.

With your permission I would like to use the text and images from your website, so I can have a description of the place, what your offer, such as hot and cold food and an image to show what the place looks like.

Thank you

Paul Day
