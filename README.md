The idea for this project came to me when I wanted to see a list of coffee shops in different towns and counties on one website. Unfortunately I found this difficult, as I had to do multiple searches to find what I wanted. On my weekend bike rides I have discovered lots of coffee shops, and some of them have a theme.

I wanted to change that by creating a website that has information and links to cafes in different towns and counties.

### UX

This website is for both the young and old who want to find out information about cafes quickly and easily. When they come to the website they can choose between three counties. After clicking on one of the options they will see the cafes for that county with an image of the cafe, a description and information about the place split up into four sections. Each section provides easy to see and read infomation to help the user select a cafe. The information provides basic at a glance information, such as outdoor seating, public transport links and snacks or cakes. The how to find us section has the cafe pinned on a Google Maps location card which can be expanded to fill an entire tab or Google Maps app. Then there is the opening hours section and the contact us section, with address, phone number, email address and website link.

* As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal

The first user type I wanted the older generations to have access to a list of coffee shops in different counties in one place so they can browse through them. It would be easy for them to see the key information then be able to go to their website for further information.

For the younger people that have smartphones, they would be able to access the site, see the key information and use Google Maps to guide them to the cafe.

### Features

#### Existing features

* Feature 1 - Location of cafe using an embeded Google Maps. The user can see at a glance where the cafe is and if they click on it Google Maps will open up in a new tab and give users the full Google Maps experience

* Feature 2 - Newsletter sign up. When the user clicks on the link for the contact Us page the user has the option to sign up to the monthly newsletter

* Feature 3 - Link to cafe website. The user can click on the link to open the website in a new tab and find out more details about the place

* Feature 4 - Send cafe details. When the user clicks on the link for the contact Us page the user has the option to fill in details about a cafe they have found. The minimum details required are the cafe name and city, and a message pops up to remind them to fill these in if they haven't done so

#### Features left to implement

My first feature would be to add a photo gallery for each cafe, which displays images in a scrolling carousel of their cakes and inside and or outside of the cafe. The user would be able to click on each image to expand it, scroll through as many of the photos as the wish and easily close it when they are finished.

Another feature would be a page split up into three sections with one for each county. Each section would have descriptions, links and images for walks and places to visit nearby each cafe. The links for places to visit would take the user to the website for that place. The links for walks would take the user to different webites with walk ideas.

I would have a page with a Google Map on it to show where all of the cafes are

My final update would be to connect this website to a database and have the infomation stored in that along with lots more cafes. The user would be able to searcvh for for a cafe based on search criteria.

### Technologies used

#### HTML5

HTML5 was used to build the pages and display the text and images on the screen.

#### CSS3

CSS3 was used to style the cafe images and descriptions on each of the pages. This is to allow the users to view the images and text properly and clearly on large, medium and small screens.

#### Bootstrap

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap was used to create the two sections of the contact us page by clicking on the copy html link and pasting them on to the page. Booststrap was also used to add the column classes to the divs within rows, so the content would change responsivley on large, medium and small screen sizes.

#### Font Awesome

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

Font Awesome was used to add icons at the beginning of the following paragraph's in the cafe's contact details:

* Address
* Phone
* Email
* Website

It was also used for the following items in the At a glance for each cafe:

* Food
* Outside seating
* Dogs allowed
* Public transport
* Parking

#### Google Fonts

I have used Google Fonts to style the font used on all pages.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

#### Github

I have used a Github repository to store all of the html and css files, the images used, wireframe pdf files and the Readme.md file.

* [Github](https://github.com/)

#### Gitpod

I used Gitpod to write and save the html files and CSS and store the CSS in a folder. It was also used to upload the images and wireframes into seperate folders. All of the work was saved bit by bit by using git commands.

* [Gitpod](https://cd5781b0-ba09-43db-ba86-1aa063eb2cd6.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/#/workspace/milestone1)

#### Embed Google Maps

I used this to get the location of the cafe in Google Maps, and I was able to adjust the size of the map to my requirements.

#### W3 Schools

I used this website to check on what I would need to do to build some of my ideas and also to make sure some of my code was correct.

#### Stackoverflow

I used this website to help explain the z-index for keeping the nav menu at the top of the screen when scolling

### Testing

#### W3C Markup Validation Service

I used this website to make sure each page of html was correct, and then I was able to correct the mistakes.

#### W3C CSS Validation Service

I used this website to make sure the style.css page was correct, and then I was able to correct the mistakes.

### Deployment

To make it easier for me to test my website in different browers and different devices I deployed my website to Github Pages. This allowed me to test the website on smartphones, tablets, Windows laptops and desktops, in Parallels desktop and my Mac mini. I tested the site in Chrome for Mac OSX and Windows, Safari and Microsoft Edge.

To deploy the website I followed these steps

1. Logged into my GitHub account
2. Clicked on the link for my milestone1 project
3. On the row of icons near the top of the screen underneath the repository name I clicked on the Settings option (the last option)
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5. At the top of the GitHub Pages section there is a section called Source
6. In this section I clicked on the dropdown menu called Branch and selected master
7. Then I clicked on Save
8. Once I had done that the published link appeared just above the source section, which is https://paulday966.github.io/milestone1/

If I wanted to download my code so I could work off line I would follow these steps. Follow these steps to get to the options

1. Log into my GitHub account
2. Click on the link for my milestone1 project
3. On the row of icons near the top of the screen underneath the repository name click on the <> Code option (the first option)
4. Just underneath this row of options, click on the green button labbelled Code with two downward facing arrows
5. Three options will appear in the dropdown.

#### Option 1 Clone with HTTPS

The first one will allow you to Clone with HTTPS

#### Option 2 Open with GitHub Desktop

Clicking on the second one will allow you to Open with GitHub Desktop. If you don't have the program installed it will take you to a webpage where you will be given the option to download the program for your operating system.

#### Option 3 Download ZIP

The third option will allow you to download a zip file with all of the files in it to your computer.

There is no need to use external hosting for this project as GitHub Pages can generate a link that allows me to access the website on mobile devices and desktops anywhere I want. This is becuase this project doesn't have a back end to it such as a database. It only has static pages. This will also save a lot of time as I don't have to go through the process of setting up an account with an external hosting company and making sure the site gets transfered accross properly and GitHub is free to use.

### Credits

#### Content

The navigation menu for each page was copied from the mobile first Whiskey Drop mini project I created during the previous module. CHECK THIS. This menu was exactly what I needed, so I changed all of the links and names of the links to the pages in my project and added in the contact page. I deleted the sign up section.

I copied the footer from the resume project, then deleted the links to LinkedIn, Pinterest and YouTube. I changed the name from Social to Social Media and removed the uppercase and general-sub classes. I added my own class to the social media title of footer-heading and changed the social-links class to social-media-links. I deleted the download CV link as it wasn't needed and removed the wording for the about section and added my own wording. I removed the uppercase and general-sub classes and added the footer-heading class and changed the title from About to About Us.

#### Acknowledgments

I got the inspiration for this project from cycling with the [Cheam and Morden CTC group](https://cheamandmorden.blogspot.com/) over many years. I found very few websites that had inforamtion about lots of different cafes in one place, and had to remember the cafe and website so I could look it up and get the details I needed.

I would like to thank my friend Anja in the walking group I'm a member of for suggesting the title Quirky Cafes. This is much better than Cafe Locator, the title I was using, and makes it a more friendly and welcoming website. 

Sent the following email to the nine cafes used in this website asking for their permission to use their text and images.

Hi,

I'm currently studying an online full stack developer course with Code Institute and Learning People. This course teaches me how to build websites and how to write programs. For my first project  I'm building a website with links and information about coffee shops.

With your permission I would like to use the text and images from your website, so I can have a description of the place, what your offer, such as hot and cold food and an image to show what the place looks like.

Thank you

Paul Day
